Hi All,
<br/>
<p>
    We are counting down the days until we’re hanging out on the most perfect Caribbean island surrounded by the people we care about most—you! 
</p>
<p>
    Below is information on Smuggler’s Cove, the hotel we’ll be staying at for our wedding celebration in St. Lucia.  You’ll find rates, a map and Q+A section.  
    There is no rush to book.  We just want you to be aware of your options and allow you to start planning ahead.  
</p>
<p>
    Also, most flights to St. Lucia next March are not yet available.  We will be in touch again when we book our flights!  
</p>
<p>
    <strong>234 days until “I do!”</strong>
</p>
<br/>
<p>Lots of love, </p>

<strong>Q + A:</strong>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Our wedding activities are from March 19 - 24, but is it possible for guests to customize their dates and number of nights?</strong></li>
    <p>We will offer the same rates 5 days before your activity dates and five days after.</p>
    <li><strong>Is there a separate rate for kids? </strong></li>
    <p>Children between the ages of 3-16 should pay US$50 per person, per night. Children under 3 are free.</p>
    <li><strong>Can we guarantee that rooms will be next to others in our party?</strong></li>
    <p>We cannot guarantee that all of the rooms will be close together; this is based on availability at the time of rooming.</p>
    <li><strong>Some rooms are very far from the main activity areas.  Are there special accommodations for guests who may have a difficult time getting around?</strong></li>
    <p>
        We will try our best to accommodate with rooms closer to the main activity areas.  However, if availability does not allow at the time of rooming we have a buggy 
        service that will take them to their rooms when requested.
    </p>
    <li><strong>Do our guests have to book a specific way to get the group rate?  </strong></li>
    <p>Guests will need to book online through a specific wedding link that we will create and provide for your group.  <em>Coming soon!</em></p>
    <li><strong>Is a deposit required to hold each room?  Is it refundable?  </strong></li>
    <p>
        A 13% deposit is collected right at the time of booking by Regatta (reservation services company providing our group discount) in order to secure the room. 
        It is applied towards the total cost of the room. Then, the hotel will collect a further 50% deposit per room with-in a few days of booking, leaving only the balance due on arrival.
        <br/>
        The deposit is refundable as long as you cancel 15 days prior to arrival.
    </p>
    <li><strong>When is final payment due by?</strong></li>
