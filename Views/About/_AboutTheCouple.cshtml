    <h2>How they met...</h2>
    <p>
        Corri and Mike met in the grandest of fashions—<span style="color: #ccccff;">at work!</span>  After several failed attempts to woo each other at the office, 
        it took Mike’s cousin kidnapping Corri and whisking her off to Jersey to get the sparks flying.  Their relationship was a 
        secret for only a couple weeks until coworkers caught them kissing at a Christmas party.  
        <br/><br/>
        It was clear early on that they met 
        their matches for life—both are a little bit nerdy and have ridiculous shoe obsessions.  After several trips between the 
        Jerz and Harlem, Mike shooting his first gun in Idaho, Corri moving to Jersey where Mike attempted (and failed) to teach her 
        how to drive a manual car, the adoption of a crazy puppy named Jax and Hurricane Sandy the question was popped!
